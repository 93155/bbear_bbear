Throughout the decade, depression has become a common mental disorder worldwide with a growing of affected population. As indicated by WHO, approximately 3.8% of population, 280 million, suffered from depression. Among all, 10.7% of adults and 15% of young people has reported depressive emotion, with 70% of them take anxiety and depression as their major problems in US. As depression is one of the priority conditions covered by WHO for its severeness and high prevalence rate, we would like to focus our research on analysis of the potential factors that affect depression.

## How can we tell the depression?
A growing body of evidence shows that people with depression use language differently. Many studies have unveiled a class of words that can help accurately predict whether someone is suffering from depression. The most robust language marker of depression is the frequency of using first-person singular pronouns, such as I and my. Moreover, specific negative descriptors are linked to the tendency of depression.

Under this context, we have applied **sentiment analysis** to automatically sort text data from Quotebank by positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. The further goals of our project are 
- Analyzing the correlation between the frequency of using negative words and seasons 
- Analyzing the change in the number of negative words each year, and identifying whether the growing number of negative words is related to significant events by date. For example, if we can identify more negative words in 2020 due to the occurrence of COVID-19.
