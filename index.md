## Depression

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/93155/bbear_bbear/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Use language markers to analyze the relationship between depression and seasons or international events

A growing body of evidence shows that people with depression use language differently. Many studies have unveiled a class of words that can help accurately predict whether someone is suffering from depression. The most robust language marker of depression is the frequency of using first-person singular pronouns, such as I and my. Moreover, specific negative descriptors are linked to the tendency of depression.

Under this context, we have applied sentiment analysis to automatically sort text data from Quotebank by positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. The further goals of our project are (1) Analyzing the correlation between the frequency of using negative words and seasons (2) Analyzing the change in the number of negative words each year, and identifying whether the growing number of negative words is related to significant events by date. For example, if we can identify more negative words in 2020 due to the occurrence of COVID-19.
